# KtxGuard ![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coverage-85-green) ![GraalVM](https://img.shields.io/badge/GraalVM-21-blue) ![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kotlin-100-orange)

KTXGuard is a minimal tool built with Ktor (Kotlin 100%). It leverages the power of Kotlin for back-end services and provides robust encryption utilities without external library and without any internet request. (educational purpose only)

## Features    ![Algorithm](https://img.shields.io/badge/Algorithm-AES/DES/RSA-red)
* Robust encryption utilities including AES, DES, and RSA.
* Command-line interface tools for easy management.
* Dependency Injection with Koin for easy management and scalability.
* Unit tests with Kotlin test framework.

## USAGE ðŸ› 

To effectively use our tool, you need to familiarize yourself with the available command-line options:

#### 1. Choosing an Algorithm

The algorithm for encryption or decryption is specified with `-a` or `--algorithm`. Currently, the supported algorithms are:
- `rsa`
- `aes`
- `des`

For example:
```shell
-a aes
```

#### 2. Encrypting & Decrypting
To encrypt a string:

```shell
-e "Your String Here" -a ALGORITHM -p PASSWORD
```

To decrypt a string:

```shell
-d "Encrypted String Here" -a ALGORITHM -p PASSWORD
```

To encrypt a file:

```shell
-ef /path/to/your/file.txt -a ALGORITHM -p PASSWORD
```

To decrypt a file:

```shell
-df /path/to/encrypted/file.txt -a ALGORITHM -p PASSWORD
```

#### 3. Specifying an Output
If you'd like to specify an output file for your encrypted or decrypted content, use the -o or --output option:

```shell
-ef /path/to/your/file.txt -a ALGORITHM -p PASSWORD -o /path/to/output/file.txt
```

#### 4. Help & Listing Algorithms
If you need a reminder on the available options:

```shell
-h
```

To list all available algorithms:

```shell
-l
```

#### 5. Generating Passwords & QR Codes
To generate a random password:

```shell
-r
```

To generate a QR code from a public key:

```shell
-qr
```

#### 6. Providing a Password
Specify a password for encryption or decryption using -p or --password:

```shell
-p "YourPasswordHere"
```

Note: If you don't provide a required argument via command line, you'll be prompted to enter it interactively.
